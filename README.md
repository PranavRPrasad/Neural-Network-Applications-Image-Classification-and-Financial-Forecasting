# Brief description
+ Developed a CNN model to classify whether the given image (input) was a dog image or a cat image (classification task), achieving an accuracy exceeding 75%.
+ Developed an RNN model to predict the closing value of bitcoin of a day (regression task), achieving a coefficient of determination of ~0.99.

# Prerequisites for the CNN model (classification task)
+ You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martingbz/petimagescorrected.
+ After downloading the dataset, unzip the zip file and rename the unzipped folder as "petimages".
+ Ensure "petimages" and the code are in the same location.

# Note
+ The versions of the libraries I've used for both the programs are:
  + torch 1.13.0
  + torchvision 0.14.0
  + pandas 1.4.4
  + numpy 1.23.2
  + sklearn 1.2.0
